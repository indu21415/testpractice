#  Write a program "list_grouping.py" that takes a list and splits into smaller lists of given size. For example,
# if lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], size = 2, it should return [[1, 2], [3,4], [5,6]] and
# if lst = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], size = 4 then it should return [[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8],[9]].

l = [5,67,8]
for i in l:
    i.split()
print(i)
